This is the main repository for the GVGAI/VGDL recommender system.

Current goals:

- The Graphical User Interface is being changed to be more straightforward. 

- Video tutorials are in development to explain the GVGAI/VGDL (http://gvgai.net/) concepts easier and make the process of design games faster and simple.

How to give a look at the project now:

Install the Java Development Kit 8 or superior

In 5 Steps:

1. Clone or download the repository. 
2. Add the Jetty server libraries (you can download them here - https://bit.ly/2FJUcYG)
3. Add the JSON Simple library (here - https://bit.ly/2RHG88s)
4. Run the class jetty.server.ContextualServer.java
5. Type localhost:9001 on your browser (so far, chrome and safari are the ones most suitable for running the project)

If you just want to play the games or seing the agents playing them:

1. Go to the load tab
2. Select a game from the list
3. Go to the level map tab
4. Select the agent you want to see playing the game (or human if you want to play by yourself)
5. Select play

If you want to see how the recommendation works

1. Start by adding sprites, which you can do at the Sprite Set tab (or removing them if you want it)
2. Click on the button (Ask for recommendations)
3. You will see a list of sprites showing up at the right side of the screen
4. Click on them and add they to your game sprite set (left side of the screen)
